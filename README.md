> Inspire the Next Generation

[NXpyre](https://nxpyre.com/) is a platform connecting youth and professionals to inspire youth to seize opportunities beyond school and pursue their interests and career aspirations. Our motto is "Inspire the Next Generation", encompassing NXpyre's mission to create a community of youth and working professionals to ensure the accessibility of career information for the next generation of professionals in all fields. Using NXpyre, youth will learn from experienced peers and working professionals about a plethora of fields (e.g. Computer Science, Architecture, etc.) and job experiences (e.g. internships, apprenticeships, full-time work, etc.) via animations. Hence, youth will be better-informed regarding careers, inspiring them to realise their dreams and take the first step towards their aspirations.

To achieve our mission, NXpyre engages Teachers, Artists, Learners. Teachers include working professionals and youth with employment experience who wish to share their wisdom with the NXpyre community! Teachers will write "lessons" about their fields and job experiences, and those lessons will be transformed into animations. This is done by Artists, talented individuals passionate about art and animation who are recruited into NXpyre's team. Finally, Learners watch the animations and learn about a multitude of fields and careers, inspiring them to pursue their career aspirations!
